This repo will contain a series where I will reconnect with neural nets (because I missed them) 

| Day   | Activities                                                                                     |
|-------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| DAY 1 | BERT Embeddings, LLM Roleplay to find the best system message, Implication of DeepSeek R1    |
| DAY 2 | Training a simple neural net, Pydantic with Gemini API (structured output for PDF processing) |
| DAY 3 | Visualizing the neural net, Understanding it a little deeper                                  |
| DAY 4 |Implementing a perceptron from scratch|
| DAY 5(session 1) | Implementing a neural net from scratch mini-batch training, regularization techniques, stopping criteria|
